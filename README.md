As an owner of a collection, I would like to be able to document information related to my items. I would like to add where I've obtained these items, and what meaning they have to me.

I as a big enthusiast for collecting things,I am struggling to remember where everything I've obtained is from since my collection got bik. Therefore I'd like to utilize some kind of web app to jot all the information.

I love journaling, and as a owner of collection I want each object I own to be also a journal for the item, I love journaling for myself, and I'd like to attempt to journal as the items I own.

My love for collecting things is unmeasurable. Therefore I'd like to also create a Digital Backup of the things I have, and digitize their stories, where they come from, and most importantly store photos of them.

As an avid collector, I've heard from people that collections can get large, and that memories can get distorted. So I want to journal all the things I'm sure about so that information remains unchanged in my mind.
